# TODO

* the reset jumper is right above the oscillator, so it may short (it's through hole)
* add place layer outline for debug connector (easier to pick&place by hand)
* LEDs are not very well visible
* use smaller holes in the long header (to align with 3pin headers)
* not enough space to move BOOT jumpers
* should the power line be connected to A0? it seem to power the probe even with power switch off
